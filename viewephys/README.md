This tutorial will show you how to:

- Load a snippet of raw data, and destripe it
- Load the corresponding spike sorting data occuring during this raw data snippet
- Place the information into viewephys, and navigate the user interface

You will investigate:
- What signals are visible onto the raw data, giving you a sense of why we want to perform destriping
- Whether the quality of the raw data is subjectively good
- Whether the spike detection is subjectively good
- Whether there is information contained in the spikes rejected as part of bad units
