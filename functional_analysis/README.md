# Assignment: Analyze neural activity on the IBL website

## Objective

Use the IBL website to explore raw and processed neural activity.

## Assignment

Open the [IBL website](https://viz.internationalbrainlab.org/app) in your browser (no installation required).

In the "Session Selector" section at the top of the page, use the right-most tab above the search bar to select the spike sorting results from 2024-05-06.

Using the "Single Cluster Overview" section at the bottom of the page, find a neuron that differentially encodes
* stimulus side, using panel D (hint: check pid `fdeff6df-7216-4b83-ab64-241e9fd173da`)
* block type, using panel B (hint: check pid `c4f6665f-8be5-476b-a6e8-d81eeae9279d`)
* feedback type, using panel E (hint: check pid `769b42dc-acf3-4079-b09e-ec979568d297`)

Using the "Session Overview" section near the top of the page, find a probe
* that has relatively stable firing rates over the course of the session using panel A.
* where individual neurons become obviously more or less active over time - for example see the deeper channels of pid `06b677d6-b074-4444-bd4a-3235a310e6e0`. Can you find others? Would you include these neurons in your analyses?
